* coursesdb

Write a module that implements a database of courses and students. The database consists of three tables:

- a table of courses each identified by a unique integer course id. A course has a title, which is a string of up to 60 characters, a year, and a semester defined by one character, either 'F' for fall or 'S' for spring.

- a table of students, each identified by a unique integer id. A student has a name, which is a string of up to 30 characters, and an enrollment year.

- a table representing the enrollment relation between students and courses. That is, which students is or was enrolled in which course. Each row in this table has a student id and a course id.

The module must implement the application programmer interface (API) defined and documented in the coursesdb.h header file.
