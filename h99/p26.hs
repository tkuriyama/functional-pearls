-- (**) Generate the combinations of K distinct objects chosen from the N elements of a list

-- In how many ways can a committee of 3 be chosen from a group of 12 people? We all know that there are C(12,3) = 220 possibilities (C(N,K) denotes the well-known binomial coefficients). For pure mathematicians, this result may be great. But we want to really generate all the possibilities in a list.

-- ["abc","abd","abe",...]
